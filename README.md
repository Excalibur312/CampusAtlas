# CampusAtlas
The aim of our project is to enable people who will go to university to do research in a comfortable way and to do research with the university's own sites one by one.

The use of our project can download the project directly and connect to the database and use the project comfortably.


You can download the CampusAtlas.dbo of the project and connect it easily, in the future part of the project we will make the DBO online and make it easy to use.
